## Project Description

In India, managing traffic flow efficiently is crucial to reducing congestion and improving safety. Our system leverages YOLOv8 for real-time object detection to analyze traffic conditions and dynamically adjust traffic signal timings.

## Features

- **Real-Time Traffic Monitoring**: Utilizes YOLOv8 for detecting and tracking vehicles at intersections.
- **Dynamic Signal Adjustment**: Adjusts traffic signal timings based on real-time traffic analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Provides insights and analytics on traffic patterns.

## Technologies Used

- **YOLOv8**: For object detection and vehicle tracking.
- **Python**: Primary programming language for development.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and video capture.

## Getting Started
